# Rings Cheatsheet
A step-by-step visual journey through Ring Signatures, starting from generic legacy signature and progressively introducing the various \*SAG flavours with their properties. Deeply inspired by [Zero to Monero: Second Edition](https://www.getmonero.org/library/Zero-to-Monero-2-0-0.pdf), this cheatsheet has been proposed as Monero official documentation via [PR \#1496](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/pull/1496), resulting in its publication on [getmonero.org](https://www.getmonero.org/library/) since March 16th, 2021.
